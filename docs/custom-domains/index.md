CordX offers a wide variety of Domains and Sub-Domains for our users to use and interact with
on top of providing a "Bring your own Domain" service which allows users to use their own Domain.

## Custom Domains
To use your own custom domain is actually quite simple if you have been given an account on the CordX website just follow the steps below
1. Create a CNAME DNS Record for the Domain of your choice that points to `us.north.cordx.wtf` or `us.east.cordx.wtf`
2. Save your changes and wait for DNS Propogation.

- If your domain does not work or respond after 24 Hours please contact our Support Team on our Discord.

## Available Domains
- Domains marked with a `*` are wildcards and can be used with any sub domain.
- Visit the dashboard using one of these domains and redownload the config to use it.
- Wildcard domains can not be used under a HTTP(s) Certificate as per Cloudflares Terms
